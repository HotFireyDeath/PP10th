                <p class="animated fadeIn" style="animation-delay: 0.8s;">
                    When a person runs as a candidate for President, they need to announce that fact first. 
                    This person must then file a statement of candidacy to the FEC within 15 days of the law’s 
                    financial threshold ($5000). Then, they must state a principal campaign committee that will
                    receive contributions and make expenditures. The chosen committee must also file a statement
                    of organization to the FEC, which also identifies the candidate’s name, treasurer, bank 
                    depositories, and any other committees that are designated.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The timing of the initial announcement is crucial because of the political impacts, and also 
                    because of the legal and tactical implications that may occur.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Due to the fact recent nominations are won during the primary campaign rather than the convention, 
                    and that primaries are proliferated and are scheduled earlier in the election year, competitors 
                    are pressed to announce their running campaign much earlier than before.

                <p class="animated fadeIn" style="animation-delay: 0.8s;">
                    The candidates fundraise and campaign before the primaries. This is to help develop the candidate’s 
                    campaign and reputation in the public. Usually fundraising helps provide money for their campaign, and 
                    debating helps get their intentions and principles across to people.

                <p class="animated fadeIn" style="animation-delay: 0.8s;">
                    Primaries and caucuses are the first step to eliminate some running candidates. Primaries are events 
                    where a party will elect for candidates who will continue forth, while the other candidates who do not get 
                    enough votes will be eliminated. Caucuses are community held events in the local area where a party holds 
                    a discussion and vote to decide the candidates who will continue forth from the ones eliminated.

                    This is an electoral event where residents of Iowa will meet together in the state and elect delegates, 
                    like most caucuses. The Iowa Caucus is the first caucus to hold a ballot vote in the United States, and 
                    receives lots of media coverage.

                    This is a primary election that happens in New Hampshire. The New Hampshire primary is known for being the 
                    first primary election in the United States (much like the Iowa Caucus is the first caucus to hold a ballot 
                    vote), and receives massive media coverage.

                <p class="animated fadeIn" style="animation-delay: 0.8s;">
                   The National Convention is a political convention held by the different partaking parties in the election. 
                   The primary purpose of the National Convention is to select and decide on the party’s nominee running for 
                   President. Additionally, they are to create a platform, which is a set of statements that adopt the party’s
                   goals and principles; these goals and proposals are known as ‘planks’. During the National Convention, a vice 
                   president is also nominated.

                <h3 class="animated fadeInDown">Fall Campaign</h3>
                <p class="animated fadeIn" style="animation-delay: 0.8s;">
                   During fall, the candidates use many methods of campaign such as ads and bus tours. One of the methods of their campaign 
                   is bus tours. These bus tours take the candidate across different parts of the country, while carrying journalists, 
                   reporters, and commentators. The tour will stop by designated cities where the candidate can make speeches and other 
                   engagements, and attempt to relay their messages.
                   <br>
                   <br>
                   Another method used by candidates during the fall campaign are ads. These ads help convey the candidate’s goals and 
                   principles, and help persuade people who watch these ads. Additionally, some ads will desecrate other candidates.
                   <br>
                   <br>
                   One of the more known events that happen during the Fall season are the Presidential Debates. During the debates, the 
                   candidates from the largest running parties (currently Republican and Democrat), will engage in a debate. This debate 
                   discusses controversial issues at the time, and are primarily at swaying undecided voters, or those who are not in a party yet.

                   <br>
                   Swing states are states that have similar levels of support among voters of the party. These states do not have overwhelming 
                   votes of one party, and are focused on a lot more during the campaign by the candidates.

                <p class="animated fadeIn" style="animation-delay: 0.8s;">
                   In term, general elections are elections held at any level (such as cities, counties, states, etc.) that competes between at 
                   least two parties. The major general election is the Presidential Election, where voters will select presidential electors that 
                   will vote through the Electoral College. The Presidential Election will decide the next president from the running candidates.

                <p class="animated fadeIn" style="animation-delay: 0.8s;">
                   The Electoral College is the body of government that elects the President and Vice President. The citizens of the US do not 
                   vote directly for a President or Vice President, but rather choose “electors”, who pledge to vote for particular candidates.
                   <br>
                   <br>
                   The number of electors per state is equal to the number of members of Congress in that state.
                   <br>
                   <br>
                   The candidate who receives a majority of electoral votes (currently at 270), will be elected into the Presidential Office.

                    The Presidential Inauguration is a ceremonial event which marks the start of a new four-year term of Presidency. During the 
                    inauguration, the new elected President must take the oath of Presidency. It is often regarded as a celebration event of the new 
                    President of the United States.
